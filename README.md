# Piscine Python for Data Science

### Dive into Python like never before!





## Summary:

The goal of this project is to introduce you to arrays, their manipulations, and their use in image processing with Python.

## Introduction

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in web development, automation, and data science. In this training program, you will explore arrays and their applications in handling images.

## General Rules

- Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc.), except in cases of undefined behavior. If this happens, your project will be considered non-functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.
- You must use Python **3.10**.
- Global variables are not allowed.
- All your code must follow the **PEP8** guidelines (use `flake8` for linting).
- Your Python scripts should always include a `main()` function.
- Each function must include a documentation string (`__doc__`).
- Your library imports must be explicit (e.g., `import numpy as np`).

## Specific Instructions

- No code should be written in the global scope.
- Any exception not caught will invalidate the exercises, even in cases of expected errors.
- You can use built-in functions unless explicitly prohibited.
- All programs should have a structured `main()` function:
  ```python
  def main():
      # Your tests and error handling
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
  ```

## Mandatory Exercises

You will go through several exercises, each covering key concepts in Python:

- **Exercise 00: Give my BMI**

  - Implement functions to calculate BMI and check if values exceed a limit.

- **Exercise 01: 2D Array**

  - Manipulate and slice 2D arrays while handling errors.

- **Exercise 02: Load My Image**

  - Load an image and print its format along with its RGB pixel content.

- **Exercise 03: Zoom on Me**

  - Load and zoom into an image while displaying scale information.

- **Exercise 04: Rotate Me**

  - Extract and transpose a portion of an image without using built-in transposition methods.

- **Exercise 05: Pimp My Image**

  - Apply color filters to an image using specific operations.

## Submission and Evaluation

- Your work must be submitted in the assigned **Git repository**.
- Only the content inside your repository will be graded.
- Peer evaluation and automated tests will be used to assess your work.

Use your brain and happy coding! ðŸš€
